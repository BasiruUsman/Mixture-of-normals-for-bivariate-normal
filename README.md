# Mixture-of-normals-for-bivariate-normal
There are several ways one can check for a normality of a data, some of which includes; the probability plots, shapiro test, anderson-darling, and cramer. Later we will see in details how to use those tests. In the maximum likelihood estimators(MLE) we take a slightly different approach using the hint provided in Casella book.
